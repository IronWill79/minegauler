  Minefield
    Minefield class, a 2D grid with a number of mines in each cell.
    Arguments:
      x_size - Number of columns
      y_size - Number of rows
    Attributes:
      mines - Number of mines it contains
      per_cell - Maximum number of mines allowed in a cell
      mine_coords - A list of coordinates, one for each mine
      completed_board - A grid representing the completed board
      openings - A list of openings, each opening is a list of coordinates
      bbbv - The 3bv of the game
    Methods:
      create(mines, per_cell=1, safe_coords=None) - Fill the minefield randomly
      create_from_list(coords, per_cell=1) -
